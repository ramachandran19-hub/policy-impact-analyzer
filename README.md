# Policy Impact Analyzer

A full-stack learning project built to explore how cloud-based applications can be used to analyze and visualize policy-related data.

## Project Overview
The Policy Impact Analyzer is a web-based application with a React frontend and a Node.js backend that processes structured policy data and visualizes trends using charts.

This project was developed as part of academic and self-learning exploration of full-stack development and cloud deployment concepts.

## Tech Stack
Frontend:
- React.js
- Material UI
- Chart.js

Backend:
- Node.js
- Express.js

Cloud & Tools:
- AWS (used during deployment for learning)
- GitHub
- VS Code

## Project Status
The application was tested locally during development. AWS services were used during deployment to understand cloud workflows. The project is currently maintained as a learning and demonstration model.

## What I Learned
- Full-stack development using React and Node.js
- Backend API creation and data processing
- Frontend dashboards and charts
- Cloud deployment basics using AWS
- Project structuring using GitHub

## Note
This is a student learning project and not a production-level application.
